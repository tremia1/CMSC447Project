# The Adventures of Coco and Koko and the Escape from the Cobblestone Forest

This game features two characters - a cat and a dog, each with their own unique set of skills. The cat can perform a high jump, fit through small places, and avoid fall damage, but cannot go through water. The dog, on the other hand, can push large objects, sniff for hidden items, and swim in water. However, the dog cannot fall from high places. The game includes several puzzle elements such as buttons that detect when the player steps on or off them, doors that open when the puzzle is solved, and moveable boulders that react to being pushed. These puzzles are reactive based on the character, making the gameplay more engaging. Additionally, the game has unique elements such as water that only the dog can swim in, and dirt piles scattered across different levels that allow the dog to dig and reveal a hidden button. Colliding with water resets the level, and the dog's sprite animation changes when it is in water.
